A possible new feature could be the ability to chat in-app with other users. The app currently finds friends using Facebook, so this in-app chat should be distinct from a social networking chat like Facebook offers.

The main purpose of this chat would be to finalize the logistics of meetings. For example, if a user schedules lunch with another user, a chat room instance would open. This instance would only be available to these two users. The two users would use this room to talk about things such as deciding where they will eat or where they will meet. The chat instance would be deleted one day after the meeting between these two users are finished, but the app will prompt the users if they would like to save the chat log. This means that if the two users then schedule another meeting, they will be given a new chat room.

I have two reasons for deleting the chat room. First, it will allow users to understand that it is not a purposeless chat and it is meant for the meeting. When the meeting is done, it's not important any more if they organized a carpool or not. Second, a chat room that will be deleted might lead to the users being more open and friendly with each other. If a user knew what he said wouldn't be "permanent" (the chat log may be saved optionally), he would probably speak more casually and with more humour.
